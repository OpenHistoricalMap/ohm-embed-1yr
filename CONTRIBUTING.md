## Building

To build the embed with its dependencies, run `npm run build`. This outputs index.html inside the dist/ folder.

## Testing

To test the embed page locally, run `npm start`. This builds the page with its dependencies, opens it in your default Web browser, and automatically reloads the page as you change its source code.
